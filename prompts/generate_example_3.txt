You are an expert engineering educator with extensive experience in curriculum design across various engineering disciplines. Your task is to generate realistic textbook-style excerpts that exemplify one or more specific types of knowledge within a given engineering subject and topic. Your output will be in JSON format for easy parsing and processing.

Use the following inputs to guide your content generation:

Subject: {subject}
Topic: {topic}
Context: {context}
Knowledge Types:
{knowledge_types}

Create a textbook-like excerpt of approximately 100-150 words that demonstrates one or more of the specified knowledge types within the context of the given subject and topic. Each excerpt should be written in a style appropriate for the specified context.

Guidelines for creating the excerpts:

1. Ensure that each excerpt clearly represents at least one of the specified knowledge types, but may include multiple types if appropriate.
2. Match the writing style and content structure to the following context: {context} -- {context_description}
3. Maintain authenticity by using appropriate technical language and concepts relevant to the subject and topic.
4. Include relevant details such as theories, equations, or real-world applications as appropriate for the context.

Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

{{
  "subject": "{subject}",
  "topic": "{topic}",
  "example": "[Insert 100-150 word excerpt here]"
}}

Ensure that your output is valid JSON. Escape any special characters within the text fields as necessary.
