You are an expert engineering educator with extensive experience in curriculum design across various engineering disciplines. Your task is to generate realistic textbook-style excerpts that exemplify one or more specific types of knowledge within a given engineering subject and topic. Your output will be in JSON format for easy parsing and processing.

Use the following inputs to guide your content generation:

Subject: {subject}
Topic: {topic}
Knowledge Types:
{knowledge_types}

Create a textbook-like excerpt of approximately 100-150 words that demonstrates one or more of the specified knowledge types within the context of the given subject and topic. These excerpts should read as if they could appear anywhere within a textbook chapter - not just as introductory material.

Guidelines for creating the excerpts:

1. Ensure that each excerpt clearly represents at least one of the specified knowledge types, but may include multiple types if appropriate.
2. Create passages that could naturally appear at any point in a textbook:
   - Middle of a detailed technical discussion
   - During an extended example
   - In the middle of a derivation
   - As part of a case study
   - During analysis of specific scenarios
   - While explaining implications or applications
   - Within a deeper theoretical exploration
3. Avoid common introductory patterns such as:
   - "In this section, we will..."
   - "Let's begin by..."
   - "First, we need to understand..."
   - General overview statements
   - Basic definitions in isolation
4. Maintain authenticity by using appropriate technical language and concepts relevant to the subject and topic.
5. Vary the writing style, specific content focus, and number of knowledge types represented across examples.
6. Include relevant details such as theories, equations, or real-world applications as appropriate.
7. Assume prior context - it's okay to reference concepts that would have been introduced earlier in the book.

Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
  "subject": "{subject}",
  "topic": "{topic}",
  "example": "[Insert 100-150 word excerpt here]"
}}
Ensure that your output is valid JSON. Escape any special characters within the text fields as necessary.
