Computer Science,Intro to Software Design,"In developing a real-time traffic management system, engineers must balance performance and reliability with ethical considerations. For instance, ensuring data privacy while utilizing location tracking involves adhering to GDPR standards. The system also requires robust error handling to prevent crashes that could lead to accidents. This project demonstrates the application of object-oriented design principles in software development (PRAC). Additionally, considering how traffic management impacts urban planning highlights the interdisciplinary nature of computer science (INTER), emphasizing the importance of integrating ethical guidelines into every stage of software development and deployment (ETH).","PRAC,ETH,INTER"
Computer Science,Intro to Software Design,"In the realm of software design, understanding the limitations of current paradigms remains crucial for aspiring engineers. For instance, while object-oriented programming (OOP) has revolutionized software development with its emphasis on modularity and reusability, debates persist regarding its scalability in large-scale systems and maintainability issues under certain conditions. Moreover, recent studies highlight the potential of functional programming to address some OOP limitations, such as conciseness and immutability. However, the transition from procedural to functional paradigms poses significant challenges for traditional software developers, making it an ongoing area of research.",UNC
Computer Science,Intro to Software Design,"In the realm of software design, understanding how to apply engineering principles in real-world scenarios is crucial. For instance, when designing a robust web application, developers must consider both functional and non-functional requirements. To illustrate this, let's examine a case study involving a fintech startup. The team employed agile methodologies, integrating automated testing frameworks like JUnit and Selenium from the onset to ensure software quality. Adherence to professional standards such as OWASP guidelines for security is paramount, as seen in regular code reviews and penetration testing sessions. Ethical considerations also come into play, particularly when handling user data. Ensuring compliance with GDPR and other regulations not only protects users but also mitigates legal risks.","PRAC,ETH"
