Computer Science,CS 1114 – Intro to Software Design,"In software design, encapsulation serves as a fundamental principle that ensures data integrity and modularity. This concept involves bundling the data with the methods that operate on that data, restricting direct access to some of an object's components. By defining public interfaces for interaction, we can ensure that changes in one part of the system do not inadvertently affect others. For instance, consider a class representing a bank account, which includes private attributes such as balance and account number, alongside methods for depositing or withdrawing funds. This encapsulation protects the data from unauthorized access while allowing controlled operations, thus maintaining the integrity of financial transactions."
Computer Science,CS 1114 – Intro to Software Design,"In this chapter, we explore the practical application of software design principles through real-world case studies. For instance, consider a scenario where a healthcare provider needs to implement an electronic health record (EHR) system. This project requires adherence to professional standards such as HIPAA compliance and use of secure data encryption technologies like TLS/SSL. Students will learn how to apply modern design patterns and frameworks, such as MVC architecture in web development, to create robust solutions. Additionally, ethical considerations are paramount; students must ensure their designs protect patient confidentiality while also being accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Real-world challenges often force teams to make trade-offs between security, usability, and efficiency, highlighting the dynamic nature of software design."
Computer Science,CS 1114 – Intro to Software Design,"In this course, we explore how software design principles intersect with various real-world domains. For instance, understanding user experience (UX) design is crucial for creating effective software interfaces that cater to end-users in a wide range of industries. This involves not only technical knowledge but also insights from human-computer interaction research and psychology. Similarly, when designing a database management system, engineers must consider the integration with data analytics tools like SQL or NoSQL databases, bridging the gap between data storage and business intelligence applications."
